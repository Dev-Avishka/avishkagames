      <p>
        Greetings! I'm a passionate 16-year-old game developer with a deep love for programming in 
        object-oriented languages like Java and C#. My journey in the world of game development has been marked
        by a relentless pursuit of creativity and innovation. From crafting two immersive 3D games entirely
        from scratch using my custom Java game engine to embarking on the exciting adventure of building 
        'Shattered Reflections' in Unity, I am dedicated to bringing captivating virtual experiences to life. 
        My commitment to mastering the intricate dance between technology and imagination fuels my ability to
        design intricate gameplay mechanics, script engaging interactions, and create immersive narratives. 
        As a lifelong learner, I eagerly embrace new challenges and technologies, ensuring that my creations 
        continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the gaming realm. Join me on this exciting 
        journey as we explore new worlds and redefine the art of gaming together.
